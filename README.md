# Sugar-Cosmetic
It is Unit 3 Project
Hi everyone,

I am Jai Krishna Singh, I and my 5 colleagues Harshit Tripathi, Faizan Khan, Deepak Kumar Singh, MohdElyas Khan, and Hari Prasad cloned the Sugar Cosmetic website. I would like to thank Masai for giving us this opportunity.

We started our project on 03 April 2022 and divided our work. Every one of us was very excited to make our project at Masai. I got my part where I have to create the homepage. First, when I started writing code I was like very comfortable as Swanand Kadam sir taught so many things in a very easy way that helped a lot during the “Construct Week”.

I started by building the homepage and I tried to make it very close to the original website I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery for giving scrolling effects just like the original website, it was working very fine and my teammate also liked it.

Talking about the login/signup and “add to cart” page it was created by Harshit, he designed the functionality and look of the page with very perfection, he did an amazing job by using some of the advanced technology like “debounce”, “setInterval” and many more which were really good.

He used some of the creative things like giving discounts by just entering “INDIAN” at the apply coupon part and also debounce functionality on the payment page to give a great user experience.

Now coming to the navbar, it was created by Deepak. He used his talent and skill with very perfection. He used some of the best things like import and export which we learned recently in the 3rd unit. The navbar in which he gave options for various pages and the search bar was also working well.

Faizan and Elyas both created and designed various product pages for which they both used new ES-6 technologies and syntax and they also provided features to add to the cart. Their efforts made the flow of the website seamless and attention-grabbing.


Now talking about the last member of our team Hari, he was very disciplined, punctual, and hard working throughout our “construct week”. He was the first who created a “ WhatsApp” group and gathered all of us and he was the first person to complete his given task on time. He created the Blog page for our website for which he used an amalgamation of all the things I discussed above.


So this was the journey that we all will remember and definitely I am hoping to work with all of these guys again in the future.
